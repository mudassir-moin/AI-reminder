# AI-reminder
AI-assisted reminder application focused on intelligent task scheduling, priority-based notifications, and adaptive reminders based on user behavior.

This project is an AI-assisted reminder application designed to improve personal task and event management. The system explores intelligent scheduling, priority-based reminders, and adaptive notification logic. The project is being developed using AI-assisted tools (Bolt) as part of independent learning in full-stack application development, APIs, and system design. A functional prototype is currently deployed and under active development.

## Technologies & Tools
React (Frontend), Node.js & Express (Backend), REST APIs, Lightweight Database (Prototype), AI-assisted development via Bolt, Cloud-based prototype deployment.

## What I Am Learning
- Application structure and workflows
- Frontend vs backend responsibilities
- Using APIs in applications
- AI-assisted development methodologies

## Current Status
This project is currently under development. A functional prototype has been deployed using Bolt.

## Live Prototype
